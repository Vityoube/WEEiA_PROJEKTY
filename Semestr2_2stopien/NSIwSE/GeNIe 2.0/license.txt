Welcome to GeNIe, a development environment for building decision-theoretic
models. GeNIe has been developed in the Decision Systems Laboratory at the
University of Pittsburgh.

The programs are made available in a compiled form, free of charge for any
use (this permission includes explicitly potential commercial use).

Even though we are making GeNIe and SMILE available to the community, the
programs and all accompanying graphics and manuals are copyrighted by the
Decision Systems Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh, and cannot be copied
or distributed without our explicit permission. The only legal way of
obtaining the programs or any of their components is directly from the
Decision Systems Laboratory, for example by downloading them from our WWW
pages. We require that interested individuals contact us directly or visit
our web site for the most recent copy of the programs. This ensures the
quality and completeness of the programs and accompanying manuals. It also
allows us to keep track of who is using the programs and to notify the
users about updates and new releases.
